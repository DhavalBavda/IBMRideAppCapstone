âœ… 1xx â€“ Informational (rare in APIs)
100 Continue â†’ Initial part of request received, continue sending
101 Switching Protocols â†’ Used in WebSockets/HTTP2 upgrades

ðŸ‘‰ Rarely used directly in Node APIs.
âœ… 2xx â€“ Success
200 OK â†’ Standard success (GET, PUT, DELETE)
201 Created â†’ Resource created (POST register, create order, etc.)
202 Accepted â†’ Request accepted but processing is async (e.g., background job)
204 No Content â†’ Success but no response body (common for DELETE)

âœ… 3xx â€“ Redirection (used in auth flows)
301 Moved Permanently â†’ Resource moved (rare in APIs)
302 Found â†’ Temporary redirect (OAuth, login with Google, etc.)
304 Not Modified â†’ Used with caching (ETag, If-Modified-Since)

âœ… 4xx â€“ Client Errors
400 Bad Request â†’ Invalid syntax, missing fields, wrong format
401 Unauthorized â†’ No valid authentication (not logged in / invalid token)
403 Forbidden â†’ Authenticated but not allowed (role-based restrictions)
404 Not Found â†’ Resource not found (wrong ID, missing route)
405 Method Not Allowed â†’ Wrong HTTP verb used (POST on a GET route)
409 Conflict â†’ Resource already exists (duplicate email/phone)
410 Gone â†’ Resource was deleted and is no longer available
415 Unsupported Media Type â†’ Wrong Content-Type (expect JSON, got XML)
422 Unprocessable Entity â†’ Input is semantically wrong (e.g., Aadhaar length invalid)
429 Too Many Requests â†’ Rate limit exceeded (API throttling)

âœ… 5xx â€“ Server Errors
500 Internal Server Error â†’ Unexpected error/crash
501 Not Implemented â†’ Endpoint not supported
502 Bad Gateway â†’ Upstream service failure (reverse proxy, load balancer)
503 Service Unavailable â†’ Server down/overloaded
504 Gateway Timeout â†’ Upstream service didnâ€™t respond in time

ðŸš€ Daily Use Status Codes in Node.js APIs
Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll use most of the time in real projects:
200 OK â†’ successful GET/PUT/DELETE
201 Created â†’ successful POST
204 No Content â†’ delete success
400 Bad Request â†’ validation errors
401 Unauthorized â†’ login/token missing/invalid
403 Forbidden â†’ role-based denial
404 Not Found â†’ missing resource
409 Conflict â†’ duplicates
422 Unprocessable Entity â†’ semantic validation errors
429 Too Many Requests â†’ rate limiting
500 Internal Server Error â†’ fallback for unknown errors
